Started with a HelloWorld Spring Boot app on 30.5.2023.

Creation of classes progression:
- GuitarController -> Guitar, Material -> GuitarRepository
-> schema.sql, data.sql -> GuitarDTO -> GuitarService

How the JPA (Java Persistence API) works:
1. Mark the class you want to be the row of a table with @Entity
2. In that class, mark an id with @Id and @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
3. If no table name is specified, JPA assumes that the table name is equal to the class name
4. The entity class has to have a default empty constructor
5. Create a ClassRepository interface that extends JpaRepository

"ChatGPT says this: Here are the commonly used methods available by default [after extending the JpaRepository]:

-> findAll(): Retrieves all entities of the specified type.
-> findById(ID id): Retrieves an entity by its ID.
-> save(S entity): Saves an entity (inserts or updates) and returns the saved entity.
-> deleteById(ID id): Deletes an entity by its ID.
-> count(): Returns the count of entities.
-> existsById(ID id): Checks if an entity with the given ID exists.
-> findAllById(Iterable<ID> ids): Retrieves a list of entities by their IDs.

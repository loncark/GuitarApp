It's a message broker that allows multiple publishers (including or excluding you) to send message to it and one consumer to consume these messages.

Steps to make it work in Anypoint Studio:

1. Download the ActiveMQ server and run the activemq.bat in win64 folder.
2. Access the broker on localhost:8161 with admin/admin credentials.
3. Create a new queue.
4. In Anypoint Studio, decide if you want to publish or consume messages from the queue. Pick the appropriate JMS connector and dnd it to the screen.
5. Setup the JMS Config file: Add the recommended libraries for ActiveMQ Connection and pick 'Edit inline' for Factory Configuration. Here paste 'tcp://localhost:61616' as a broker url.
6. Test the connection (while the ActiveMQ server runs in the background).
7. Set the destination setting of your connector to the name of the queue you created in step 3.
8. Specify what message you want to send in the body.
9. Build and run the Mule app.
10. Send to it the appropriate request using a REST Client.
11. If everything goes well, refresh the ActiveMQ broker tab and you will see that you have a pending message with the body you specified in the connector settings.
